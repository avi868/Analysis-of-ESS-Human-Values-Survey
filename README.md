# Analysis-of-ESS-Human-Values-Survey
This repo consists of the R markdown file, its pdf output and our data set in csv format. The data set was downloaded from https://www.europeansocialsurvey.org/data/themes.html?t=values. After this was downloaded, the csv file was moved into the ESS_Human_Values folder. Due to the amount of data in this survey, we only used data from selected countries and only from the first and last rounds of the survey. More information about the countries chosen and why they were chosen are in the document. 
This was done directly from the website with these parameters which made it easier for data cleaning. After the data set was obtained from the url, it was put into the ESS_Human_Values folder and then used for analysis. 



[IMPORTANT] RStudio Cloud must be used to obtain the data. Due to many technical difficulties experienced in this project, ultimately the Cloud version of Rstudio was used which did not make much difference for analysis but made a difference in the file path needed to load data and images. Due to this, running the markdown file on desktop may result in a different file paths from the one we used in our code which may cause the compilation to halt. 
  To run this program, please download the entire ESS folder and load into RStudio cloud. Within this folder, you can load the dataset into the R environment by running the datacleaning.r file contained in ESS_Human_Values/scripts. 
  After this is done, you can then run the markdown file located at ESS_Human_Values/outputs/paper.
